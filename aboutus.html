                            <h1>Wai Wai's Place History</h1>
                            <p>- Wai Wai restaurant name is the owner name and the Wai Wai started the business <b>11 years ago</b> and it went very well, Wai Wai used to work for her dad's convenient shop and she thought of her starting her own business but she thought it was impossible but her dad told her "Nothing is impossible" and she spent all her money investing and opened up her first restaurant and a hotel and the business was booming.</p>
                            <P>- Later she opened not one but two other restaurants, but the business came crashing down when COVID happened and she had to close all her restaurant and hotel but she opened 1 restaurant and it went pretty good but most of the time she doesn't make much profit since she mostly donate her food and money to people in need but now she handed down he business to her younger sister and it went pretty well and Wai Wai is now in Belgium retired.</P>
